# Strata Brand Book

## 1. Brand Essence

### Mission

To replace opaque hiring processes with structured, explainable intelligence that empowers human decision-making.

### Vision

A world where every candidate evaluation is transparent, evidence-based, and free from bias—where AI acts as a glass box, not a black box.

### Positioning Statement

For forward-thinking founders and HR leaders who demand precision, Strata is the candidate evaluation platform that transforms messy hiring data into clear, comparable signals. Unlike traditional "magic" AI tools that hide their logic, Strata reveals the "why" behind every score, ensuring trust and control remain in human hands.

### What Strata Is vs. What It Is Not

- **Strata is:** Structured, Transparent, Explainable, Objective, precise.
- **Strata is NOT:** Magic, Opaque, "Smart but silent", Chatty, Playful.

## 3. Logo Usage Guidelines

### The Symbol

![Strata Logo](/home/itsaibarr/.gemini/antigravity/brain/595c1583-101e-4596-864c-918eac942a06/uploaded_media_1770745793460.png)

**Meaning:**
The minimalist horizontal bars represent **strata**—layers of data, structured evaluation, and stacked signals. The geometry suggests filtering, sorting, and clarity emerging from noise. It is a technical, engineered mark that conveys stability and precision.

### Usage Rules

**Full Logo:**

- Use the symbol with the wordmark "Strata" (set in the primary font, confident and tracking-adjusted).
- Primary usage is on dark backgrounds (Deep Navy/Black) with the Red Accent symbol.

**Icon-Only:**

- Use for avatars, favors, and constrained spaces (e.g., mobile app header).

**Clear Space:**

- Maintain a clear space equivalent to the height of the central bar around the entire logo.
- No other elements (text, graphics) should intrude into this zone.

**Backgrounds:**

- **Primary:** Dark technical backgrounds (Deep Slate, Night Blue).
- **Secondary:** Clean white/light grey backgrounds (use the dark version of the logo).
- **Avoid:** Cluttered photography, low-contrast gradients, or vibrant patterns that compete with the geometry.

**Don'ts (Never Do This):**

- Do NOT rotate the logo.
- Do NOT add drop shadows or glow effects (unless specifically part of a high-fidelity dark UI component).
- Do NOT change the aspect ratio or stretch the bars.
- Do NOT use the logo in non-brand colors (e.g., green, purple).

## 4. Color System

### Primary Palette

**Strata Dark (Background)**

- **Hex:** \`#0F1115\`
- **Purpose:** Primary background color. Creates depth and focus.
- **Emotion:** Stability, infinite space, focus.

**Strata Red (Accent / Brand)**

- **Hex:** \`#FF4747\` (Approximated from logo)
- **Purpose:** Primary action buttons, key data signals, logo mark.
- **Emotion:** Urgency, alert, precision, signal interaction.

### Neutral Palette

Used for UI surfaces, borders, and text hierarchy.

- **Surface Dark:** \`#181B21\` (Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces)
- **Border:** \`#2D313A\` (Subtle, technical definition)
- **Text High:** \`#F5F5F7\` (Primary headings)
- **Text Medium:** \`#9BA1AD\` (Body text, labels)
- **Text Low:** \`#5E6573\` (Placeholders, disabled states)

### Functional / Semantic Application

- **Success:** \`#22C55E\` (Verified, High Match)
- **Warning:** \`#F59E0B\` (Missing Data, Review Needed)
- **Error:** \`#EF4444\` (Critical Mismatch, System Fail)
- **Info:** \`#3B82F6\` (Neutral Signals)

**Signal Glows:**
To emphasize active signals in the "Glass Box", semantic colors can be paired with a subtle glow effect.

- **Usage:** Behind active status indicators, high-match scores, or critical alerts.
- **Style:** 20-40% opacity blur radius equal to the element height. Do not overuse; reserve for "live" data.

**Accessibility:**

- Always maintain WCAG AA contrast ratio for text.
- Use distinct shapes/icons alongside color for colorblind users (e.g., status dots + text labels).

## 5. Typography System

### Primary Typeface: Inter

A geometric, highly legible sans-serif that balances technical precision with human readability.

- **Usage:** All headings, body text, UI labels.
- **Weights:**
  - **Regular (400):** Body text.
  - **Medium (500):** UI labels, buttons.
  - **SemiBold (600):** Section headings, emphasis.

### Secondary Typeface: JetBrains Mono

A monospaced font for data, code, IDs, and raw signals.

- **Usage:** Candidate IDs, confidence scores, technical metadata, JSON snippets.
- **Weights:** Regular (400) only.

### Type Hierarchy

| **Role**          | **Size** | **Weight** | **Tracking** | **Case**             |
| :---------------- | :------- | :--------- | :----------- | :------------------- |
| **H1 Display**    | 32px     | SemiBold   | -0.02em      | Sentence             |
| **H2 Section**    | 24px     | Medium     | -0.01em      | Sentence             |
| **H3 Card**       | 18px     | Medium     | Normal       | Sentence             |
| **Body Base**     | 14px     | Regular    | Normal       | Sentence             |
| **Small / Label** | 12px     | Medium     | +0.01em      | Uppercase (Optional) |
| **Mono Data**     | 12px     | Regular    | Normal       | N/A                  |

**Principle:** Keep type hierarchy flat. Rely on weight and color (luminance) over dramatic size differences.

## 6. Visual Language

### Shapes & Geometry

- **Rectinilear:** We value structure. Shapes are rectangles with slight softening.
- **Radius:** Strictly **4px**. No pill shapes (except status badges), no fully rounded buttons.
- **Stroke:** Thin, precise borders (1px solid).
- **Icons:** Thin stroke (2.40px). Minimalist, geometric style (e.g., Phosphor or Lucide).

### Structural Grids

- **Concept:** Structure is our core value. Make the grid visible.
- **Usage:** Use faint border lines (\`#2D313A\`) to define modular areas.
- **Glass Effect:** Use subtle semi-transparency (backdrop-blur) on panels to hint at depth, but keep it "technical glass" (clean, sharp edges).

### Luminous Signals

- **Concept:** Intelligence emerging from the dark.
- **Usage:** Use gradients and glows to highlight key data points.
- **Guideline:** A single "laser" point of light is more powerful than a flooded neon screen.

### Abstract Data Topography

- **Concept:** Visualize the complexity of data without showing the mess.
- **Style:** Use layered lines, topographic map patterns, and dot matrices.
- **Avoid:** Generic 3D robots or brains.

### Layout & Spacing

- **Grid:** Rigid 4px / 8px baseline grid.
- **Density:** High. We engage professionals who need to see data. Minimize "airy" whitespace in favor of rigorous grouping.
- **Scanning:** Use horizontal rules and subtle background differentiation (zebra striping or paneling) to guide the eye across complex data rows.

### Data Visualization

- **Style:** Flat, 2D charts. No 3D, no shadows, no gradients.
- **Signals:** Use the primary accent (Red) sparingly for "Critical" or "Focus" data points. Use neutrals for context.
- **Clarity:** Every data point must have a label or tool-tip. No "mystery meat" navigation or charts.

## 7. Product UI Principles

### Information Density

- **Principle:** Strata is a tool for power users (Recruiters, HR Managers).
- **Execution:** High density. Use compact rows, split panes, and collapsible details. Avoid excessive white space that requires scrolling.
- **Metric:** 12-14px base font size for data tables to maximize visibility.

### Scoring & Signals

- **Color Coding:** Scores (0-100) must be color-coded for instant scanning.
  - 85-100: Perfect Fit (Strata Green)
  - 60-84: Good Fit (Strata Blue)
  - <60: Muted / Low Signal (Muted Red)
- **Visuals:** Use progress bars or donuts for scores, but always pair with the raw number.

### Explainability-First

- **Rule:** Never show a score without a "Why".
- **Pattern:** Hover states or "View Details" drawers must reveal the specific signals (keywords, experience duration) that contributed to the score.
- **Errors:** If AI cannot evaluate a section, explicitly state "Insufficient Data" rather than guessing.

## 8. Brand Do's & Don'ts

### ✅ Do

- Use data to back up claims.
- Use strict, technical layouts (grids, clear borders).
- Speak directly to the user's intelligence.
- Use the dark theme for the primary product interface.

### ❌ Don't

- Use illustration styles that are cartoony or "corporate Memphis" style.
- Use vague language like "synergy" or "holistic".
- Hide complexity for the sake of "minimalism" if it obscures value.
- Use rounded, bubbly UI elements that feel like a consumer social app.
